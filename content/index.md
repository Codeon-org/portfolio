  title: "Powered by Curiosity"
  ---
  **I question everything**—APIs, algorithms, even the naming of variables. **Curiosity** doesn't kill cats in my world; it ships features and writes tests. Side effects may include deep dives into RFCs and unexplained tabs in Chrome.

  title: "Knowledge Has No Expiration Date"
  ---
  **I love sharing** what I learn—whether it's code, tips, or weird bugs that became features. If it helps someone else level up, it's a win. Warning: May spontaneously start screen-sharing.

  title: "Clean Code, Clear Mind"
  ---
  **I'm a minimalist** who believes less is more—even when it comes to caffeine. **No coffee needed to ship clean**, scalable code (just willpower and maybe some toast). **Runs on water**, curiosity, and occasional sarcasm.
