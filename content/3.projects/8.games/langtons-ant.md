A visual simulation of Langton's Ant cellular automaton created with Processing.

## Goal

- Implement the Langton's Ant simulation on a 2D grid.
- Visualize the ant's movement and cell color changes in real time.
- Allow the simulation to run continuously or pause with user input.
- Explore emergent behavior from simple deterministic rules.

## Why I Built It

I built this project to explore cellular automata and demonstrate how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent patterns. Langton's Ant is a classic example of how a minimal set of instructions applied to a grid can produce unpredictable and interesting behavior, making it a fascinating subject for visualization and experimentation in Processing.

## Tech Stack

| Area        | Technology    |
|-------------|---------------|
| Programming | Processing    |
| Visualization | Processing graphics API |

## What I Learned

- How to implement Langton's Ant logic with direction and movement control.
- Managing a large 2D grid to track cell states efficiently.
- Using Processingâ€™s pixel manipulation functions (`loadPixels()`, `updatePixels()`) for fast rendering.
- Handling screen wrapping to create a toroidal (wrap-around) grid.
- Incorporating user input to pause and control the simulation.

## Features

- Continuous simulation of Langton's Ant following the classic rules.
- Color-coded grid cells that change state as the ant moves.
- Real-time rendering optimized with pixel array manipulation.
- Keyboard control to pause or resume the simulation.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Optimizing pixel rendering to maintain smooth animation over a large grid.
- Ensuring correct handling of direction and wrapping without glitches.
- Managing simulation speed for visual clarity while processing many steps per frame.
