A multiplayer Pong game built in Java leveraging RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for networked play and JavaFX for the graphical interface.

## Goal

- Implement a real-time multiplayer Pong game.
- Use Java RMI to enable communication between game clients.
- Create a responsive and interactive UI with JavaFX.
- Synchronize game state between remote players.
- Provide smooth gameplay experience over the network.

## Why I Built It

I built Pong RMI to explore Javaâ€™s Remote Method Invocation capabilities and understand how to structure multiplayer networked games using Java. Combining JavaFX for rich UI with RMI allowed me to create a simple yet functional multiplayer experience while learning about distributed computing concepts and synchronization challenges in game development.

## Tech Stack

| Area        | Technology |
|-------------|------------|
| Programming | Java       |
| Network    | Java RMI    |
| GUI         | JavaFX     |

## What I Learned

- How to use Java RMI to enable remote communication between clients.
- Managing concurrency and synchronization in a networked multiplayer game.
- Designing a simple yet effective network protocol for real-time gameplay.
- Building a responsive UI using JavaFX components and animation.
- Handling latency and state updates between distributed players.

## Features

- Multiplayer Pong game with two players connected over the network.
- Real-time synchronization of ball and paddle positions.
- Smooth animations and responsive controls via JavaFX.
- Simple game start, pause, and reset functionality.
- Basic scoring system and game state management.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Handling network latency to keep both clients synchronized smoothly.
- Managing concurrent remote method calls without conflicts.
- Ensuring the UI remains responsive while waiting for remote updates.
- Implementing thread safety for shared game state accessed via RMI.
