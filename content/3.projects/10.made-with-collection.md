A lightweight JavaScript library that adds customizable "Made With" badges to your website using icons from the Simple Icons project.

## Goal

- Provide a simple and customizable badge component for showcasing technologies used in a website.
- Leverage the Simple Icons library for consistent branding and wide icon support.
- Support multiple integration methods (NPM, CDN, direct download) for flexibility.
- Offer multiple themes and sizes out-of-the-box for quick customization.

## Why I Built It

While working on personal and client websites, I often wanted to display simple “Made With” badges that represent the technologies used. I couldn’t find a lightweight, dependency-free solution that was flexible and modern. This project solves that by offering a plug-and-play badge system using well-known and maintained icons from the Simple Icons project.

## Tech Stack

| Area          | Technology                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Language      | JavaScript                     |
| Delivery      | CDN, NPM, or direct download   |

## What I Learned

- How to create a reusable JavaScript library for frontend integration.
- Proper structuring for distribution via NPM and CDN.
- DOM manipulation using data attributes for customizable UI components.
- Integrating third-party icon libraries while respecting licensing and branding guidelines.

## Features

- Easily add badges to any HTML element using a simple class and data attributes.
- Choose from over 2000+ icons available in the Simple Icons collection.
- Support for three sizes: small, medium, and large.
- Two built-in themes: light and dark.
- Works with module imports, CDN scripts, or manual installation.
- No dependencies — just plain JavaScript.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Mapping the correct icon slugs from Simple Icons to match user expectations.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility with no external dependencies.
- Providing enough flexibility for developers while keeping the API minimal.
