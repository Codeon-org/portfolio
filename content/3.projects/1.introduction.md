description: A brief overview of my projects and the journey behind them.

This page highlights a selection of personal and collaborative projects I've created over time. Each project represents a learning opportunity — a chance to dive into new tools, solve real problems, or just have fun building something from scratch.

## Why I Build Projects

Creating projects has always been my preferred way to learn and grow. Whether it was a simple game or a complex tool, each project started with curiosity and a desire to improve. Here are some of the key goals behind these projects:

- **Discover New Programming Languages**: Trying out languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Processing (Java), and PHP helped me understand different paradigms and use cases.
- **Explore Frameworks and Tools**: I experimented with modern frameworks such as Symfony, React, Vue.js, and others like Electron to expand my frontend and backend capabilities.
- **Explore Techniques and Architectures**: From algorithmic challenges to Clean Architecture and Test-Driven Design, I used projects to experiment with better coding patterns and maintainability.
- **Improve Code Structure and Readability**: I aimed to write cleaner, more modular, and more testable code with each new iteration.
- **Practice Project Management**: By scoping features, setting milestones, and tracking progress, I learned how to manage my time and deliver working software.
- **Level Up in DevOps and CI/CD**: Many of my projects include automated deployment pipelines, containerization, and monitoring tools — essential skills in modern development.

## How It Started

When I began, I had limited knowledge of software development. I started building small projects to get hands-on experience. Each project in this portfolio represents a step forward — from creating games during Global Game Jam, to building real-world project like Needlify and Meeio.

Over time, I embraced more advanced workflows, picked up better habits, and discovered the value of open source contribution and technical writing.

## What's Inside

### Real-World Projects
- These projects solve actual problems or provide useful tools for myself or others.

### Games & Simulations
- Projects built to explore game mechanics, canvas rendering, user input handling, and algorithmic behavior.
- Includes solo experiments and jam entries like *Langton's Ant*, *Game of Life*, and *Multiplayer Pong*.

### Hackathons
- Time-boxed projects created during events like **Global Game Jam** and **Nuit de l'Info**.
- These emphasize rapid prototyping, collaboration, and creative problem-solving under pressure.

### Developer Tools & Utilities
- Tools that automate workflows, improve productivity, or demonstrate technical concepts.
- Includes input validators, CLI utilities, logging systems, and more.

### Bots & Automation
- Small projects that leverage APIs and scheduled tasks to generate or distribute content.
- Example: Twitter bots that post ISS locations or NASA images.

### Proofs of Concept
- Experimental codebases used to test frameworks, design patterns, or infrastructure setups before full implementation.
