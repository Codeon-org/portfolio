A lightweight and dependency-free PHP library to add colorful output to your terminal. Perfect for enhancing CLI applications with easy-to-use methods and vibrant console text.

## Goal

- Provide a simple and minimal PHP solution to color console output.
- Keep the package extremely lightweight (only 1.1 KB).
- Avoid any external dependencies for maximum portability and performance.
- Offer intuitive usage for CLI developers using PHP.

## Why I Built It

- To make CLI applications in PHP more user-friendly and visually expressive.
- Existing solutions were often too large or over-engineered for simple needs.
- I wanted a quick and reusable way to color console text without any bloat.
- It was a fun and practical exercise to improve my understanding of terminal color codes in PHP.

## Tech Stack

| Area         | Technologies Used      |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Language     | `PHP`                   |
| Package Host | `Packagist`             |
| Installation | `Composer`              |

## What I Learned

- How ANSI color codes work in the terminal and how to apply them using PHP.
- Creating and distributing a PHP package via Packagist.
- Writing reusable, clean, and minimal code with no dependencies.
- Making a developer-friendly API for CLI utilities.

## Features

- Output colored text to the console in just one line of code.
- Support for 8 common colors as constants (e.g., `ColorConsole::GREEN`).
- Optional background color support for added emphasis.
- Extremely lightweight (1.1 KB) and zero dependencies.
- Simple and clean API with just one method: `ColorConsole::color()`.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Ensuring compatibility with various terminal environments that interpret ANSI codes differently.
- Keeping the API minimal yet flexible enough for different CLI use cases.
- Designing it to work with only PHP â‰¥ 7.1 while staying future-proof and portable.
