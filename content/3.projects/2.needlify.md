A developer-first blog engine that evolved from a PHP code experiment into a knowledge-sharing platform. Built, rebuilt, and reborn — Needlify reflects my growth as a developer and a writer.

## Story

**Needlify** is more than a project — it's a long-term companion that has followed me throughout my software development journey. It started on **September 7th, 2019**, as a simple PHP proof of concept during my apprenticeship. The idea was to demonstrate how to structure an N-tier architecture. But as I kept coding, that experiment quickly transformed into a self-made blog engine.

To support it, I developed **TimePHP**, a custom PHP framework that I later open-sourced. Over time, the framework grew too complex, so I pivoted and migrated the project to **Symfony**, launching **Needlify v1** on **May 22nd, 2021**. The goal was now clear: build a stable, clean, and feature-rich blogging platform.

Along the way, I created a companion project — **Lithium**, a tech newsletter launched on **January 19th, 2022** — which ran for 102 editions until **December 27th, 2023**. It was powered by automation through Notion and custom webhooks.

After learning from the limitations of v1, I rewrote **Needlify v2** from scratch and made it open source. It went live on **February 13th, 2023**, with improved architecture, performance, and content organization.

Finally, in **April 2025**, I decided to stop rebuilding and focus on writing. I migrated all content to **Ghost**, a dedicated publishing platform, and redeployed the new Needlify. Now, it’s a clean, minimal, and focused writing environment — no extra overhead.

## Goal

Build a complete, developer-friendly blogging platform that could:
- Serve as a playground for architectural and technical experiments.
- Support Markdown-based writing with search, tags, and structured content.
- Evolve into a platform for sharing thoughts, tutorials, and curated tech content.

---

## Why I Built It

- I wanted to **explore PHP architecture**, eventually leading to the creation of my own framework.
- I needed a **platform to publish technical blog posts**, document learnings, and host experiments.
- I was curious about how far I could go building a platform from scratch — and how much I could learn in the process.

## What I Learned

- **Backend Architecture**: Clean architecture, modularity, service/container separation in PHP.
- **Framework Design**: Built and maintained my own framework (TimePHP), then transitioned to Symfony.
- **Frontend & Tooling**: Built custom admin interfaces using Vue and Webpack.
- **Open Source Discipline**: Structured public code, wrote documentation, and handled issues/feedback.
- **Content Automation**: Created automated newsletter publishing with Notion API and webhooks.
- **Tech Publishing Mindset**: Balanced engineering with writing, curating, and maintaining a technical voice.

## Features

- Custom admin panel with Markdown editor
- Full-text search with support for tags and banners
- Topic-based content structure and lesson support (in v2)
- Automated newsletter system (Lithium) using Notion API
- Optimized images and minimal UI for better content focus
- Migrated to Ghost to prioritize content and writing

---

## Challenges & Improvements

- **Framework maintenance**: Building TimePHP was eye-opening, but hard to sustain.
- **Complexity growth**: Overengineering Needlify v1 made iteration and scaling difficult.
- **Rewrites**: Rebuilding v2 taught me the importance of shipping over perfection.
- **Final evolution**: Moving to Ghost allowed me to stop building and start writing.

If I were to start again, I’d build around existing CMS tools earlier — unless the goal was purely to learn architecture.
