A RESTful API for shortening URLs, built with TypeScript and AdonisJS. It allows users to create, manage, and access shortened links efficiently.

## Goal

- Provide a simple and fast API to shorten long URLs.
- Offer URL management features such as redirection and expiration.
- Learn and experiment with AdonisJS and TypeScript in a backend project.
- Gain practical experience with building REST APIs from scratch.

## Why I Built It

- To better understand how URL shorteners work behind the scenes.
- To get hands-on experience with building APIs using the AdonisJS framework.
- To deepen my knowledge of TypeScript in a backend environment.
- As a backend-focused learning project to explore clean architecture and RESTful design.

## Tech Stack

| Area         | Technologies Used   |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Language     | `TypeScript`         |
| Framework    | `AdonisJS`           |
| Database     | `SQLite`             |

## What I Learned

- How to set up and structure a TypeScript backend with AdonisJS.
- Routing, controllers, and middleware usage in AdonisJS.
- Database migrations and model creation using Lucid ORM.
- Writing RESTful endpoints and handling HTTP responses properly.
- Validating and managing user input and error handling gracefully.

## Features

- Create shortened URLs from long links.
- Redirect to the original URL when visiting the short code.
- Store and manage URLs in a SQLite database.
- Minimal and clean API design for ease of use.
- Built entirely using modern TypeScript conventions.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Setting up and understanding the AdonisJS project structure and conventions for the first time.
- Learning the ins and outs of Lucid ORM for interacting with the database.
- Handling routing logic and validation effectively in a new framework.
- Implementing proper error handling and edge case coverage in the API.
