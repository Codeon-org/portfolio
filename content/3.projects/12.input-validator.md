A lightweight PHP library that helps validate user input securely using simple helper functions.

## Goal

- Provide an easy-to-use utility for validating common input types.
- Ensure user data is validated securely before further processing.
- Reduce boilerplate code in form validation logic.
- Offer consistent and structured validation responses.

## Why I Built It

Input validation is one of the most critical aspects of secure web development. I wanted a reusable tool that could help validate email addresses, integers, string values, and patterns without having to rewrite the same logic across projects. This library centralizes common input validation tasks into a single helper class, encouraging cleaner, safer PHP code.

## Tech Stack

| Area       | Technology     |
|------------|----------------|
| Language   | PHP            |
| Features   | Reflection, Regex, PHP native filters |

## What I Learned

- How to encapsulate and abstract common validation patterns.
- Better use of PHP’s type hinting and null safety.
- Leveraging reflection and structured return types for consistent API behavior.
- Secure handling and validation of user input to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Validate email format and length using `filter_var`
- Check if a string exists in a predefined array
- Validate against custom regular expressions
- Determine if a value is a valid integer
- Handle string length checks with min/max bounds
- All validators return structured associative arrays with messages and optional metadata
- No dependencies — just plain PHP

## Challenges & Improvements

- Designing a flexible return type that could be easily parsed or logged.
- Avoiding external dependencies to keep the library lightweight.
- Managing optional parameters in a clear and readable way.
