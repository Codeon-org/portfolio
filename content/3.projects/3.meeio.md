A modern, user-friendly flashcard app designed to unlock your learning potential with advanced spaced repetition. Meeio is open source and free to use, built to help students and professionals alike retain knowledge efficiently.

## Story

**Meeio** started in **2023** as a personal alternative to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). I wanted a modern, beautiful flashcard app tailored to my needs, but couldn't find one that matched my expectations for design and functionality. So I built Meeio from scratch to fill that gap — combining ease of use with powerful features.

The project grew quickly, focused on providing a sleek UI and integrating the latest spaced repetition techniques to maximize learning effectiveness. Meeio is open source, welcoming contributions and customization to meet diverse learning styles.

## Goal

Build a flashcard application that is:

- Beautiful and modern in design, making learning enjoyable
- Powerful enough to handle complex spaced repetition workflows
- Simple and intuitive to use for all skill levels
- Open source, fostering community contributions and transparency

## Why I Built It

- I wanted a **modern and visually appealing** flashcard app that fits today's UX standards.
- Existing tools like Anki felt outdated and less intuitive to use.
- I needed a solution that **combined simplicity with advanced spaced repetition algorithms**.
- Being open source was important so I and others could **customize and improve** it freely.
- To create a learning tool that works well both for students and professionals with diverse needs.
